{"name":"Shuttle-command","tagline":"Use a modified numpad to emulate the input of commands in a space shuttle","body":"# shuttle-command\r\nUse a modified numpad to emulate the input of commands in a space shuttle.\r\n\r\n# Set-up\r\nYou need an (external) numpad and modify it to look like this image:\r\n\r\n![modified numpad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/master/img/numpad.png)\r\n\r\nThe keypad is modified to show:\r\n\r\n| original      | replaced |\r\n| ------------- | -------- |\r\n| <kbd>+</kbd>  | HELP     |\r\n| <kbd>-</kbd>  | POS      |\r\n| <kbd>/</kbd>  | ITEM     |\r\n| <kbd>\\*</kbd> | OPS      |\r\n\r\nYou'll also need a bash shell (included in most Linux distributions and in Mac OS X, emulators can be found for Windows, but can offer incomplete experiences).\r\n\r\n## Downloading the script\r\n\r\nDownload the [shuttle.sh](https://github.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/blob/master/shuttle.sh) script using your preferred method. For example through git:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command.git\r\ncd shuttle-command\r\nls\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using git instead of just downloading the files using curl, or the github zip download feature is that you can update the script when necessary using `git pull`\r\n\r\nor if you don't have git, a simple curl should also work:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl https://github.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/archive/master.zip\r\nunzip master.zip\r\ncd shuttle-command\r\nls\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be done again regularly, to ensure you have the version with the least errors as possible.\r\n\r\n## Changing the keymap\r\n\r\nTo use this method, you'll have to find out to what keys your numpad are mapped. When you find out what keycodes the keys to replaced are mapped, you can change your keymap to.\r\n\r\n| original     | replaced |\r\n| ------------ | -------- |\r\n| <kbd>+</kbd> | HELP     |\r\n| <kbd>-</kbd> | POS      |\r\n| <kbd>/</kbd> | ITEM     |\r\n| <kbd>*</kbd> | OPS      |\r\n\r\n- [ ] to do: how to change keymap\r\n\r\nWhen using the script, your \"input method\" will be \"ITEM001\"\r\n\r\n## Using the delayed input\r\n\r\nUsing this method, you don't have to change anything to your terminal or install to your machine. The drawback is that you can't see your input until pressing <kbd>EXEC</kbd>(<kbd>‚èé</kbd>/<kbd>ENTER</kbd>). This is because it has to be processed before being able to show what the several keys mean.\r\n\r\nWhen using the script, your \"input method\" will be \"ITEM002\"\r\n\r\n## Using the modified font (not recommended)\r\n\r\nDownload the [font](https://github.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/blob/master/font.otf) and install it (usually: `sudo cp -r ./font.otf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/`) or installing it using the default graphical method.\r\n\r\nTo make things easy, the first method is also included in a script called `moveFont.sh`, which can ask for your admin password.\r\n\r\nand make sure it is used in your terminal (right-click > preferences > font > For Personal Gain (regular)).\r\n\r\nThis font is modified to show:\r\n\r\n| original     | replaced |\r\n| ------------ | -------- |\r\n| <kbd>+</kbd> | HELP     |\r\n| <kbd>-</kbd> | POS      |\r\n| <kbd>/</kbd> | ITEM     |\r\n| <kbd>*</kbd> | OPS      |\r\n\r\nNow you can enter as expected on the numpad, but a drawback is that it's harder to read due to its lower size, and it changes settings for the whole terminal\r\n\r\nWhen using the script, your \"input method\" will be \"ITEM001\"\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nOpen your terminal, `cd` into the correct directory.\r\n\r\nIt could be possible that the script doesn't have the correct permissions. You can check this by doing `ls -l shuttle.sh` in the correct directory. The output should look like this: `-rwxr-xr-x 1 user  staff   6.7K Mar 18 12:06 shuttle.sh*`, important is that you at least see the first `x`, if you don't you can change the permissions using `chmod 755 shuttle.sh`.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nopen the script in terminal using `./shuttle.sh`, enter the language, the correct position and then the correct operation.\r\n\r\nThen you can enter the item-code, which will display whether it was correct or not.\r\n\r\nTo exit from a position, enter operation 999.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Operating\r\n\r\n- [ ] to do: remake the scripts to make use of `shuttle.sh`\r\n- [ ] to do: make `shuttle.sh` in such a way that it matches the script\r\n\r\nThe times at which certain codes have to be entered are written in the space shuttle script. These scripts are so far only in Dutch. They can be found at [jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/jwr-shuttle/scripts](http://github.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/jwr-shuttle/tree/master/scripts) and [jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart.github.io/jwr-shuttle](https://jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart.github.io/jwr-shuttle)\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n## Delayed input\r\n\r\nThis is the method requiring the least set-up. The script waits for a carriage return (<kbd>ENTER</kbd>), then it replaces <kbd>/</kbd> to <kbd>ITEM</kbd> etc., after which it will be showed on that line.\r\n\r\n![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/master/img/demo-del.png)\r\n\r\n## Changed keymap\r\n\r\nThis is also the preferred method for a full keyboard without alterations. By changing your keymap, the keys on the keypad will be converted to the corresponding codes when correctly set up.\r\n\r\n![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/master/img/demo-keymap.png)\r\n\r\n## Modified font\r\n\r\nThis method is optimised for input by numpad, but not great when you want to still do other things in the same window. It also requires a rather large font size to be legible.\r\n\r\n![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart/shuttle-command/master/img/demo-font.png)\r\n\r\n# Development status\r\n\r\nFor now, not all codes from [jwr-shuttle/scripts](https://jeugdwerkgroep-ruimtevaart.github.io/jwr-shuttle) have been implemented. You should be able to help by reading it and adding the codes to the appropriate moment.\r\n\r\nAlso notably WXT still needs a lot of additions to the interactive part.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n[![Creative Commons Licence](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\r\n\r\nshuttle-command is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
