Download the [shuttle.sh](shuttle.sh) script using your preferred method

Download the [font](shuttle.otf) and make sure it is used in your terminal. This font is modified to show <kbd>+</kbd> as <kbd>HELP</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd> as <kbd>POS</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd> as <kbd>OPS</kbd> and <kbd>/</kbd> as <kbd>ITEM</kbd>.

# Usage
open the script in terminal, enter the correct position and then the correct operation.

Then you can enter the item-code, which will display whether it was correct or not.

To exit from a position, enter operation 999.
